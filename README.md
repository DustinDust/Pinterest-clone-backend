```

## Running the app

## About this project
This initially started off as a school project but since this code was mostly contributed by me, I decided to have a little fork of it here at my github.
  
To run this locally, you'll need PosgreSQL database running, and a Firebase with storage bucket setup. Go to firebase console > project overview > project settings > my apps. Also you'd need a firebase credentials file which could be acquired [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup)
